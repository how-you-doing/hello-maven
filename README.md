# hello-maven
Maven is a build tool, mainly used to build and manage java projects.

## 1. First maven project
- [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the [installation instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- run ```mvn --version``` to confirm the installation 
- Create a sample project from existing templates (called `archetype`) or create one by yourself
- Check [How IntelliJ IDEA supports maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html#create_new_maven_project)

## 2. pom.xml
- The core of `mvn project` is pom.xml (`pom` refers to `Project Object Model`)
- It is a single configuration file that contains the majority of information required to build a project in just the way you want
- It has *3* important elements
    1. `groupId`- indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group
    2. `artifactId`- indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project.
    For example `JAR` name
    3. `version`- version of the project

## 3. Maven Lifecycles
- `validate`- validates the maven project that everything is correct and all the necessary information is available
- `compile`- compile the source code of the project
- `test`- test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code to be packaged or deployed
- `package`- take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR
- `integration-test`- process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run
- `verify`- run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
- `install`- install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- `deploy`- done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects
- `clean`- clean up artifacts created by prior builds
- `site`- generates site documentation for this project

## 4. Execution
- ```mvn clean```- will clear all the artificates present in the project folder
    - clears `target` directory present in the project folder

- ```mvn compile```- compiles all the source codes of the project
    - For example, `.java` files present in the `main` and `test`

-  ```mvn test```- executes the test cases present in the project
    - As a result, you will get the status something like this
    ```Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0```

- ```mvn package```- takes all the compiled source and package them as a jar
    - `JAR` can be found inside `target` directory, ex: `/home/${USER}/workspace/hello-maven/target/hello-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

- ```mvn install```- copy the generates `JAR` into local repo, so that other projects can make use of this work
    -  your `JAR` will be moved to `/home/${USER}/.m2/repository/com/hod/hello-maven/1.0-SNAPSHOT/hello-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Note
We can execute multiple phases or goals in a single line. For example,
```
mvn clean compile package
```
